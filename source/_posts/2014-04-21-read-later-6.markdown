- [GitHub Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet)  
While top 5 Ejmojis on GitHub are most important. :smile:

- [RegExr v2.0](http://www.regexr.com/)  
Very nice rework by Grant Skinner and his team.

- [node core vs userland](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/node-core-vs-userland)  
IMO the most important node paradigm. Only things that are very hard to implement for a module or almost everyone needs belong to node core. Everything else is userland.
